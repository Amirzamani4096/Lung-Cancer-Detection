# Lung Cancer Detection in CT Images Using Region Proposal Network with Integrated Feature Maps from VGG16 
Lung cancer stands as one of the deadliest known diseases worldwide, comprising nearly two-thirds of all existing cancers [1]. The mortality rate of this type of cancer among all recognized tumours is 18% . Studies indicate that early detection of lung cancer can improve treatment outcomes and increase patients' survival rates. Among the available imaging modalities, computed tomography (CT) imaging is important in lung cancer detection and diagnosis [6],[7]. With increased access to CT equipment, physicians review a substantial volume of CT images daily. However, due to the prolonged time required for physicians to examine each CT scan, errors in cancer detection may occur due to fatigue or external factors, posing significant risks to patients. Therefore, to reduce individual errors, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed to assist physicians in rapidly and accurately identifying tumours.
Lung nodule detection systems typically identify nodules in two stages. The first stage involves extracting candidate nodules to increase the system's sensitivity. Traditional methods for extracting remaining nodules used threshold-based or region-based algorithms, which perform poorly in extracting nodules with lower contrast than the surrounding tissue. The second stage involves removing false-positive candidate nodules to increase the system's precision. However, lung nodule detection approaches need more efficiency, such as lengthy processes, lack of end-to-end detectability, and challenges with larger datasets.
